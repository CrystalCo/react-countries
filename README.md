# [React Countries](http://rc.vanja.ws) &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vpetreski/react-countries.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vpetreski/react-countries)

This is small application that serves as a playground for my React learning purposes.

It's a list of countries that you can add, remove, sort, mark as visited, see on the map, etc.

Idea is to practice React basics, components and best practices, integration with APIs, project structure/organization, deployment to AWS, using libraries, etc.

[Here](https://github.com/vpetreski/react-countries/projects/2) you can see Kanban board and current tasks.

Application is deployed on AWS using S3, CloudFront and custom (sub)domain name. Check it out [here](http://rc.vanja.ws).

Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

[Here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.
